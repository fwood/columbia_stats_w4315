 \frametitle{Philosophy and Style}
\begin{itemize}
\item Easy first half.
\item Very hard second half.
\item Frequent, long digressions from the required book.
\item Understanding == proof (derivation) {\em plus} implementation.
\item Practice makes perfect.
\item Frequentist {\em and} Bayesian perspectives taught.
\end{itemize}

If you are looking for a pure applied, pure frequentist treatment of regression as a diagnostic tool and/or you've never programmed before, seek another section.

Available sections
\begin{itemize}
\item MW 9:10-10:25am, 702 Hamilton Hall (Lindquist)
\item MW 6:10-7:25pm, 209 Havemeyer Hall (Yang)
\end{itemize}

}

\frame[t] {
 \frametitle{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep theoretical understanding
\begin{itemize}
\item Book provides only recipes
\item Much detail missing
\item Can always look up recipes in future
\end{itemize}
\item Ability to implement/code {\em all} regression functionality
\begin{itemize}
\item Different levels of understanding
\item Not enough to simply be able to apply formula and use pre-built regression software
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Feedback from prior years}
\begin{quote}
Frank was often better at relaying the information when he cared about the material. For example, the sections on Bayesian Statistics were explained more clearly and thoroughly than the earlier sections. Frank answered questions well in person, but rarely responded to emails.
\newline

Prof. Wood is clearly a brilliant, fascinating individual. Everyone in the class, I think, likes him on a personal level and his teaching style. However, overall, this course was a waste of \$4,000. I paid money for an applied course in linear regression models. Instead, basically, the course was taught from a theoretical standpoint.

Frank definitely knows what he's doing; the material can sometimes be a little rough and it's not always clear what his motivations are in trying to explain some topics, but I wouldn't want to take this class with any other professor.

 \frametitle{Feedback from prior years}
\begin{quote}
Never had I had such an effective statistics instructor at Columbia. Prof Wood explained the material so well, yet very quick, and got discouraged when he spent more time expected explaining certain topics... even though it was really to the benefit of the class. I honestly wish he could teach me all of the material I have to encounter before graduation and then maybe it would make sense. My only criticism is that as energetic as he was in class, he was quite intimidating, which I think was a disservice to most of the class when he tried to facilitate class participation. Only about 15\% of the class regularly participated as a result.

 \frametitle{Course Outline}
 First half of the course is on the traditional view of linear regression.  The first half of the first half is a formal, theoretical review of single variable regression and its classical, frequentist treatment.

 \begin{itemize}
 \item Roughly 1 chapter per week
 \item 3-5 weeks, linear regression
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Least squares
 \item Maximum likelihood, normal model
 \item Tests / inferences
 \item ANOVA
 \item Diagnostics
 \item Remedial Measures
 \item Linear algebra review
 \item Matrix approach to linear regression
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


\frame[t] {

The second half of the first half covers multiple regression and the various topics that arise from including multiple predictor variables into models.

 \frametitle{Course Outline Continued}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item 3-4 weeks multiple regression
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Multiple predictor variables
 \item Diagnostics
 \item Tests
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 Midterm

\frame[t] {

The remainder of the course will deviate from the book and may be ordered differently than what is shown here.  In general we will retain a focus on models that are linear in the parameters, but will look at nonlinear models and Bayesian treatments of linear models.

 \frametitle{Why regression?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Want to model a functional relationship between an ``predictor variable'' (input, independent variable, etc.)
      and a ``response variable'' (output, dependent variable, etc.)
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Examples?
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item But real world is noisy, no $f = ma$
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Observation noise
 \item Process noise
 \end{itemize}
 \item Two distinct goals
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Tests about natural of relationship between predictor variables and response variables
 \item Prediction
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
}

\frame[t] {
 \frametitle{History}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Sir Francis Galton, $19^{th}$ century
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Studied the relation between heights of parents and children and noted that the children ``regressed'' to the population mean
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item ``Regression'' stuck as the term to describe statistical relations between variables
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Aims for the course}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given something you would like to predict and some number of covariates
\begin{itemize}
\item What kind of model should you use?
\item Which variables should you include?
\item Which transformations of variables and interaction terms should you use?
\end{itemize}
\item Given a model and some data
\begin{itemize}
\item How do you fit the model to the data?
\item How do you express confidence in the values of the model parameters?
\item How do you regularize the model to avoid over-fitting and other related issues?
\end{itemize}
\item Not be boring
\end{itemize}
