<strong>This is a master\'s / advanced undergraduate level course in
linear regression methods.</strong>

<strong>Text:</strong> 

<u>Applied Linear Regression Models</u>
 4th Ed., by Kutner, Nachtsheim, and Neter. McGraw-Hill, 2004. 


<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 
Calculus; probability and statistics at the level
of W4150, or W4105 and W4107 taken concurrently.

<strong>Corequisite:</strong> 
Linear algebra. 

<strong>Grading:</strong> 
Grades will be assigned on a curve, using the following percentages: 25% Homework, 30% Midterm, 45% Final Exam.  

<strong>Homework:</strong>
Bi-weekly. Contains a mix of paper and computer problems. The assignments and due dates will be posted on the course page every other week.
No late homework will be accepted.
Missed homework will receive a grade of zero. The
lowest score will be dropped. To receive credit
on homework, you must show all work neatly, clearly
label each problem, and staple the entire assignment together in correct order
with your name printed. No homework should exceed 10 letter-size pages (including computer outputs, thus be selective on what to turn in). The homework will be graded, and each assignment carries equal
 weight. You are allowed to work with other students on
 the homework problems, however, verbatim copying of
 homework is absolutely <i>forbidden</i>.
 Therefore each student
 must ultimately produce his or her own homework to be
 handed in and graded.
 Any questions regarding homework grades
 should first be taken up with the TA; if these
 questions cannot be resolved with the TA, then feel
 free to discuss them with the instructor. 

<strong>Exams:</strong>
There will be one in-class midterm exam, and a final exam.  All exams are required and there will be no make-up exams. Missed exams will receive a grade of zero.  All exams are open-book and open-notes. Calculators may be used during the exams. Any questions regarding exam grades should first be taken up with the TA; if these questions cannot be resolved with the TA, then feel free to discuss them with the instructor. Grades will be assigned on a curve.

<strong>Midterm:</strong> 
The midterm will be during class hours. Wednesday, Oct 20, 2010
(tentatively)

<strong>Final exam:</strong> 
In the exam week. In class, 2 hours. (TBD)

<strong>Computing:</strong> 
You will be required to use <strong>R</strong> to complete your homework assignments. 
See the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/">ACIS page</a> for
information on software and computing labs.  

<strong>Scope:</strong> 
This class is about the theory and practice of
regression analysis.  The first part of the
course will focus on the basic techniques with one-dimensional data,
and will assume familiarity with the following topics from
statistics (see appendix A in the book for a quick review, or e.g. <a

or a similar textbook for more details):

- Gaussian distributions
- Joint, conditional distributions
- Law of large numbers, central limit theorem
- Estimation
- Bias, variance, covariance
- Maximum likelihood
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals

The second part of the course will look specifically at the challenges
posed by multivariate data.  We will do a very brief linear algebra
review, but it will be essential to be familiar with the following
topics from linear algebra:

- Vectors, matrices 
- Linear transformations, bases
- Matrix inverse
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors
- Quadratic forms
- Determinants
